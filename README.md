Project-Stock Market Prediction using Python and machine Learning Algorithms 
MAIN PROJECT FILE:-  analysis.ipynb

Problem Statement:-  To improve the efficiency of Stock Market Forecasting using Machine Learning.

Why we choose it:-

The main objective of this study is to improve the prediction accuracy of the direction of stock price index movement by using the Random Forest Model. 
First, we focus on the selection of the input variables for forecasting the future trend of the stock market index. 
The selection of effective indicators that can be used to forecast the output variable of a Random Forest Model is significant prior to modelling.  
In this study, we compare two basic types of input variables that have been widely used in previous studies to predict the direction of the daily stock market index. 
To evaluate the performance of these two sets of input variables, the stock market index is used as an illustrative example. 
In addition, we improve the prediction accuracy according to the optimization of the learning algorithm of the Random Forest Model.

Technology used:-

Python 3.
Machine Learning.

What we have done till now:-

We collected past 16 years data of Stocks from NSE(National stock Exchange). We passed these data through several cost determining formulas and prepared that data to be feded in Machine Learning Modals. Currently we have only preapered data and not sends this data to machine learning modals due to limited knowledge of those Modals.
